Keep file paths short and sensible.
Don't use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of difference in Mac/Windows systems.
Always pull before you push in case someone has done work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn't want anyones's work to get lost or have to resolve many coding conflicts
